# **Partner Intelligence Analysis**  

## **📘 What This Project Is About**
This project looks at partner company websites to understand what they talk about online. By checking which keywords appear on each website, we can figure out their main focus areas—like cybersecurity, cloud services, or managed services.

The goal is to turn keyword data into clear insights that help with marketing, sales, and partner strategy.

## **🎯 Project Goal**
Use keyword data to understand partner focus areas, spot market trends, and rank partners based on how active and relevant they are.

---

## **❓ Main Question**
What can keyword data from partner websites tell us about their marketing focus and how strongly they align with key technology areas?

---

## **ℹ️ Background**
Each partner website is scanned for specific keywords.  
Every keyword is marked as:
- **1** → the keyword appears on the website  
- **0** → it does not  

There are also two helpful numbers:
- **Sum** → total keyword hits (how much they talk about these topics)  
- **Count** → number of different keywords found (how many topics they cover)

This lets us understand both **depth** and **variety** in their messaging.
