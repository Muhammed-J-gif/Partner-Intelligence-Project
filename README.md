### Project Title
Partner Intelligence Project
### Project Goal
To analyze partner website data and generate insights into their web presence, marketing 
focus, and strategic positioning — using only the keyword data. 


### Business Question
How can keyword‑level website data be used to identify partner focus areas, rank partners by relevance and engagement, and surface insights that support sales and marketing teams?

### Proposed Solution
Use keyword presence indicators to:
- Identify dominant themes across partner websites
- Profile each partner’s marketing focus
- Score partners using keyword density and diversity
- Produce dashboards and reports that summarize trends and rankings

### Background
The dataset contains partner website domains and binary indicators showing whether specific keywords appear on each site. These keywords represent product areas, technologies, and marketing themes. By analyzing keyword frequency, distribution, and clustering, the organization can understand partner positioning and identify high‑value opportunities.

### My Role
Use python and analytical methods to extract, aggregate, and interpret keyword data, then translate findings into actionable intelligence for stakeholders.
